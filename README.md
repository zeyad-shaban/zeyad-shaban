## Hi I'm Zeyad Shaban
### a [Youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFjcc0rq2guK6kJ4va49zgA/videos), Node js backend developer, React js frontend developer.

Hi, I love coding so much, I have started it due to the corona pandemic. (Many people chose to see it as a dangerous thing, while I saw it as a life-changing opportunity that will never come back).

_**Everything in life has a dark and a bright side, and you choose which one to stand on eliminating the other!**_

I'm not interested in any real-time jobs, I prefer time and freedom over money and that's why I chose to be a freelancer.  
You know, you can make hundreds of dollars in one second, but you can't make one second from billions of dollars right? So how about investing this time in a better way?

Not only freelancing but I'm investing my time trying to open a running business with my coding skills. Ok, four failed but for the current one (Youtube channel)... meh who knows?

My favorite books: "The Lean Startup" | "The subtle art of not giving a F###" | "You are a Bad#ss"

Oh btw my favorite programming language is javascript ðŸ˜„
